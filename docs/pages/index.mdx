- Updates the code snippet in **real-time** as you make changes to a request.


## Pre Request Scripting

- Pre Request scripting is now supported - see docs [Pre Req Scripting](filters/scripting)


## Scriptless Testing


- We need to write a lot of boilerplate code in Postman and other clients to do basic testing using scripting (like status code equals `200`). So we implemented GUI-based tests, where you can select a couple of dropdowns to do most standard tests easily, without any scripting knowledge.
- Tests can be done for strings, numbers, count, and type checking.
- Json schema validation.
- Re-arrange tests order using drag & drop.

#### Test Arrays
- Test array data in response using array filters [details here](testing/array-testing)

#### Set Env Variable
- You can save response data to Env Variables [details here](environment)

#### Xml Testing
- To perform tests and save response data to environment [click here](testing/xml-testing)

#### Scripting
- For Advanced use-cases you can use [Scripting](filters/scripting)

#### Response Visualization
- Create charts or tables from response [Chart View](chart-view)

## Logs

- To view the logs open `Output` Window and select `Thunder Client` in filter dropdown
- Logs will display request details and error logs

## Proxy

- VS Code proxy setting - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network#_proxy-server-support

}
```

## Privacy

- Basic anonymized analytics data is collected using [vscode-extension-telemetry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-telemetry). No personal or requests data is collected. You can opt-out using VS Code Settings [details here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry).
- There is no backend or cloud sync; all data is stored locally on your computer, but you can sync data using [git](https://github.com/thunderclient/thunder-client-support#git-sync).
## Thunder Client CLI
- There is no analytics tracking used in the Thunder Client CLI. So when you run CLI in the CI and CD build pipelines, there is zero tracking and no data is shared with us.
- When CLI is used locally along the extension, basic anonymized analytics data is collected in the extension, which can be turned off as mentioned above.
