## Team Collaboration
- This feature is useful for saving data in a `git repository` for team collaboration.

<Callout type="info">Subscription required to use this feature.</Callout>


## Git Sync



Integration with Git is supported by VS Code settings below.

**NOTE:**  choose **any one setting** as required.

### 1. Save To Workspace (Recommended):
   Enable this setting when you'd like to save requests data in the current workspace. This will create a `thunder-tests` folder in the root of the workspace. The extension will load the data automatically when you open the project in VS Code.
   - **Workspace Relative Path** (Optional Setting): The default location of the `thunder-tests` folder is at the root of your workspace. Use the `Workspace Relative Path` setting to specify a different relative path (see below for examples).
     - Make sure the `Workspace Relative Path` setting is "**Workspace**" scope, not "**User**".
     - **Example 1**: To save requests in the folder named `Child` inside the workspace, the Workspace relative path is `Child`. Similarly, for a folder `Child/folder_name` inside the workspace the workspace relative path is `Child/folder_name`
     - **Example 2**: To save requests in the Parent folder of the workspace, the workspace relative path is `../`

### 2. Custom Location:
   Use this setting when you'd like to save all of the requests data in one fixed location. Enter the full folder path to save the data.
   - Supports relative path to user root directory. Use prefix **$HOME**. e.g `$HOME/Documents/folderName`

- **Note 1**: The environments will be stored in `thunderEnvironment.json`, in the **thunder-tests** folder. If you'd like to exclude any secrets from `thunderEnvironment.json` file then use `Local Environment` to store values locally on your computer.
- **Note 2**: Please **restart VS Code** after updating settings.
- **Note 3**: Requests that existed before activating the git sync feature are not saved automatically. To save them, create the `thunder-tests` folder and copy the `.json` files found in the [default storage](#storage-location) into it.
- **Note 4**: If you use both settings, then `Save To Workspace` will be used.
