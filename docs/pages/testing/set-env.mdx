# Set Environment Variable

Setting environment variables is supported in the Tests tab. Follow the steps below:

- Create an environment first from the Env tab (if it's not already created).
- In the Tests tab, select the `Set Env Variable` dropdown option (The action will automatically become `setTo`).
- Enter the appropriate source of the variable value in the left input box:
  - **Header:** Enter `header.headerName` where `headerName` is the response header name.
  - **Cookie:** Enter `cookie.cookieName` where `cookieName` is the response cookie name.
  - **JSON Response:** Enter `json.propertyName` where `propertyName` is the JSON key in the response body.
  - **Text Response:** Enter the `text` keyword. This sets the entire response body to the variable.
  - **Custom Value:** To set any custom value manually, Just type the text as required in the left input e.g `processing`
  - **Clear Value:** To clear values use `null` keyword in the left input.
  - **Delete Variable:** To delete a variable completely use the `delete` keyword in left input.
- In the value input, enter a variable name in the format `{{variableName}}`.
  - When it matches a variable name in Env, it will turn **green**. If the variable doesn't exist, it will be created.
- Now execute the request. You will see the variable value set in the Env tab.
  - If you don't see the change in the Env tab, close and re-open the tab to refresh it.

#### Set Env with Scope

The default location will be Active Environment when you use `{{variable}}`. You can use a scope to control which environment variable to set the value explicitly.

- To set a variable in the **local** environment use `{{variable, local}}`.
- To set a variable in the **global** environment use `{{variable, global}}`.

## Set Variables in Scripting

To set Env variables from [Scripting](/scripting), please see the below examples.

```js
// To save to active environment
tc.setVar(varName, value);

// To save to local environment
tc.setVar(varName, value, "local");

// To save to global environment
tc.setVar(varName, value, "global");

// To set collection or request level variables
tc.setVar(varName, value, "request");
```
