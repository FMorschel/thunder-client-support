- We need to write a lot of boilerplate code in Postman and other clients to do basic testing using scripting (like status code equals `200`). So we implemented GUI-based tests, where you can select a couple of dropdowns to do most standard tests easily, without any scripting knowledge.
- Tests can be done for strings, numbers, count, and type checking.
- Json schema validation.
- Re-arrange tests order using drag & drop.
