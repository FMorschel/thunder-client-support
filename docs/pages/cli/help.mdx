# Help Screen

The help screen for most CLI tools is boring and difficult to understand. So we custom designed our CLI help screen to be **colorful and easy** to understand.

## Debug Information
If you have issues with the CLI reading data or reading the **git-sync** settings, run the debug command to see useful information.

- Run the debug command using â€” `tc --debug`
- This will display the **directory path** where the CLI is trying to read the data and the **git-sync** settings values used.
