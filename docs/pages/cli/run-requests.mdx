# Run Requests
The CLI and Extension are integrated seamlessly, so you can access requests data from the terminal without any additional configuration.

- To execute requests run `tc 'requestNameOrId'`, the request can be executed using id, name or partial name

As you can see in the above image, executing requests is very easy from CLI. The output is formatted beautifully with **Status, Response with Syntax highlighting & VSCode theme**, and **Test results**.


To Run the same request from **UI requires multiple steps** as below

- Open Sidebar
- Click Collections Tab
- Open collection `User` and folder `Account`
- Then open `Welcome` request
- Now execute the request

## Output Log
When the user executes a request by default — **Status, Response & Test Results** are displayed. You can control the data to output with `--log` argument.

- Log options for request: 0=All Data, 1=ReqHeaders, 2=ReqBody, 6=ResHeaders, 7=ResBody, 8=Tests
- Example: `tc 'welcome' --log 1,2,7` will display Req headers, Req Body, and Response Body.

## Open Request UI from CLI
If you like to quickly execute a request in extension UI, then you can do it easily from CLI using `--ui` argument.

- `tc 'welcome' --ui` To open a request in UI and execute automatically
- `tc 'welcome' --ui2` To open a request in UI **without auto-run**.
