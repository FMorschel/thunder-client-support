### Save Request to Collection/Folder
You can also save requests to collection or folder using cURL command from CLI.

- `tc curl 'http://httpbin.org/anything' --name 'Curl Req1' --col User` the command will add request to collection **User** with name **Curl Req1**.
- Use `--col` argument to save to collection, and `--fol` argument to save to folder, and `--name` to specify the name of request.
