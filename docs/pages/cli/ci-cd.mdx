# CI/CD Integration

Thunder Client CLI can be used in build server to run collection and save reports in **XML, HTML, JSON and CSV** formats.

1. **VS Code Settings:** If you are using any TC VS Code settings, you need to set the scope to `workspace`, so the settings will be saved to the workspace directory.
2. **Git Sync:** The collection runner in build server will work only when you enable [git sync](/team#git-sync) feature
3. **Reports:** `tc --col "ColNameOrId" --report "xml,html"` command will execute all the requests and save reports in **thunder-reports** folder

### Github Actions
- The [sample yaml file](#yaml) can be used to integrate with **Github actions** or other **build pipelines**.

### Workspace Location
- **[Optional]:** The CLI will use the current working directory as workspace directory, but if the data is in different workspace directory then use the `--ws 'fullpathToGitWorkspace'` to specify the workspace path.

### Stop Collection When Fail
- **[Optional]:** If you want to stop collection execution of other requests when a request test fails then use the argument `--stop-on-fail`

### Sample YAML File

```yaml filename="main.yaml"
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: TestBuild

# Controls when the workflow will run
on: 
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  # push:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]
  # pull_request:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Isstall Node on the runner
      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      # Install Thunder Client CLI
      - name: Install Thunder Client CLI
        run: |
          npm install -g @thunderclient/cli
          
      - name: Make Directory for results
        run: mkdir -p thunder-reports

      # Run the Thunder Client collection
      - name: Run Thunder Client collection
        run: |
          tc --col "ColNameOrId" --report cli,json,xml,html --log 8

      # Upload the contents of Test Results directory to workspace
      - name: Output the run Details
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: RunReports
          path: thunder-reports
