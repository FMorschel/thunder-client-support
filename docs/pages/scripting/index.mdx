# Scripting
There are two ways you can write custom scripting in Thunder Client for advanced use cases.
1. **Inline Scripting:** You can write javascript code inside the Thunder Client views.
2. **Custom Filters(External JS Files):** You can write code in separate javascript files and attach it to a collection.

## Inline Scripting
- JavaScript code can be written directly within Thunder Client views.
- You have the flexibility to write scripts in the following contexts:
  - Request Level
  - Folder Level
  - Collection Level
- Additionally, scripts can be authored in `Pre-Request` and `Post-Request` scripts.

### Pre Request Script
- Run Pre Request script from `Pre Run` -> `Scripting` tab, useful to set Env Variables

### Post Request Script
- Run the Post Request script from `Tests` -> `Scripting` tab
- Useful to do clean-up tasks, set environment variables from the response and assertions
