## Auth

- OAuth 2.0's **callback url**, when grant type is **Authorization Code**, needs to be entered into your oauth server trusted redirect url list.
- OAuth authentication credentials are sent **via header or body**; please select the appropriate one based on your server requirements.

- ### OAuth 2.0 Callback Url
  * You need to use the provided callback url to get access code from auth server to extension.
  * You can use default url `https://www.thunderclient.com/oauth/callback`
  * Or You can use the localhost version `http://localhost:6789/callback`
  * The Callback Url should be added to your `OAuth server` authorised callback list.

- ### Automatically Refresh Tokens
  * The `OAuth 2` tokens will be refreshed automatically at request, folder & collection level
  * The token values are saved locally and not in json files
  * You can also save tokens per environment, please enable VS Code setting `Save Token Per Environment`
  * if there is any problem, please click `Generate Token` button again, the refresh should work.

## Manual SSL Certificates

  - Provide SSL certificate paths for auth, using the relative path to the workspace or absolute paths.
  - Use the **Certificates** VS Code setting, see example below:

  ```json
  "thunder-client.certificates": [
          {
              "host": "thunderclient.io",
              "certPath": "ssl/cert.pem",
              "keyPath": "ssl/keyfile.key",
              "pfxPath": "ssl/pfx.p12",
              "passphrase": "test"
          },
          {
              "host": "localhost:8081",
              "pfxPath": "/Users/test/Documents/ssl/pfx.p12",
              "passphrase": "test"
          },
          {
              "host": "testing.com",
              "certPath": "ssl/cert.pem",
              "keyPath": "ssl/keyfile.key"
          },
      ]
  ```
